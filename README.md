# horiseon
    This repo was created in order to showcase the knowledge that I have learned in week 1 of the UCLA Coding Bootcamp.  It is a refactor of existing code.

    The following knowledge was used:
        - html best practices and clean up of code
        - html semantic html elements
        - html accessible alt attributes
        - CSS color, location, font, and selectors
